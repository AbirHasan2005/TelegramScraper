# TelegramScraper ([Read Below](https://github.com/AbirHasan2005/TelegramScraper/edit/master/README.md#use-telegram-bot))
Using this tool you can easily add so many members from any group to your group. Less than 2 minutes. Super easy. Time saver. But this tool is only for educational purpose. You could be banned from Telegram. So be careful. Recommanded to use this tool only on Termux.

## Telegram Group:

#### Join Telegram group for help, feedback, details and chats.

## How to Setup:

## Use Telegram Bot
This is very old version. I already made a better Telegram Bot where you can login your account and scrape members to add from one chat to another. Bot is very easy to use. [Check Bot Here](https://t.me/HireDev/9). So I don't want to work on this tool anymore, it's worthless. So use bot only. But remember bot will not bypass Telegram limitations. So read about Telegram limitations by your own and then use the bot. If you need more help you can contact in [Support Group](https://t.me/JoinOT).
